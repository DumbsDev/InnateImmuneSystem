        <p><b>Inflammation</b> is a vital part of the immune response, acting as the bodyâ€™s first line of defense against harmful stimuli such as pathogens, injury, or irritants. When tissues are damaged or infected, the inflammatory response is triggered to protect and heal. Initially, <b>immune cells</b>, like macrophages and mast cells, recognize the threat and release chemical signals called <i>cytokines</i> and <i>chemokines</i>. These signals serve as alarms, attracting additional immune cells to the site of injury or infection.</p>
        
        <br>
        <p>As a result of this signaling, blood vessels undergo <i>vasodilation</i>, which increases blood flow to the affected area. This is why inflammation often causes redness and heat. The increased blood flow also brings in <b>white blood cells</b>, which help to engulf and destroy pathogens through a process known as <i>phagocytosis</i>. Inflammation also increases the permeability of blood vessels, allowing essential proteins and nutrients to leak into the tissues. This causes <b>swelling</b> (edema) as fluid accumulates in the area. While this can be uncomfortable, it helps to isolate the affected area and prevents the spread of infection. During this process, pain signals are also sent to the nervous system, which prompts you to be cautious and protect the injured area. This <i>nociceptive pain</i> serves as a reminder to avoid further damage while the body works to heal. Once the threat is neutralized, the inflammatory response gradually subsides. The body begins the <i>repair process</i>, cleaning up damaged cells and tissues through apoptosis (programmed cell death) and facilitating tissue regeneration. </p>
        <br>
        <p>In summary, inflammation is a complex but essential response that helps the body protect itself from harm, signaling for help and initiating healing processes. It plays a crucial role in maintaining overall health and fighting off infections.</p>
