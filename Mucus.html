        <p><b>Mucus</b> acts as a crucial defender in the immune system. It is produced by specialized cells in the mucous membranes, lining areas such as the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and urogenital tracts. One of its primary functions is to <i>trap pathogens</i>, such as bacteria and viruses, preventing them from entering the body. Mucus contains antibodies and antimicrobial proteins that help <i>neutralize</i> these invaders. <b>Microvilli</b>, which are tiny finger-like projections on epithelial cells, increase the surface area for absorption and secretion. They help move trapped pathogens within the mucus toward the bodyâ€™s exit points, like the throat or digestive tract. When pathogens are trapped in the mucus, they are eventually cleared away through processes like <i>coughing</i> or <i>swallowing</i><br>
