        <h3 id="header">What's the Immune system?</h3>
        <p>The immune system is like your body’s security squad, fighting off germs and keeping you healthy. 
            <br>It has two unique parts: the <button class="bold innatedata" id="innate">Innate Immune System  </button> and the <button class="bold innatedata" id="adaptive">Adaptive Immune System</button>.</p>

        <h3 id="header">How does the Innate Immune System work?</h3>
        <p>The Innate Immune System is the first and second lines of defense against germs. It’s always ready to fight off invaders, even if it’s never seen them before. 
            <br>It’s made up of <b>four</b> different parts; the skin, mucus, microvilli, and inflammation. Each part has a unique role, but <i>vital</i> in keeping you healthy.</p>
    </div>

        <br>
        <h3 id="header">Let's talk about the first line of defense.</h3>
        <p>The first line of defense is your <button class="bold innatedata" onclick="location.href='Skin.html'">skin</button>.</p>
        <p>Firstly, it helps to thing of your body like a castle, and invading macteria as vikings, bandits, or other such things.
            <br> The skin is like the castle walls, keeping foreign things out. It's the first line of defense against germs, chemicals, and physical damage.
            <br> Our castle wall is a specialized kind of wall though. It's covered in <span id='slime'>slime</span>.
        <p>Not actually, but our skin does have a ph different from that of our blood and inner tissue. This confuses foreign bacterias and viruses, which assume
            a standard ph throughout the entire body.
            <br>Our body isn't covered in skin everywhere though. We have holes, like our nose or throat for example. 
            <br>These are kept safe though, as they are covered in <button class="bold innatedata" onclick="location.href='Mucus.html'">mucus</button>, which traps and stops bacteria (most of the time). Kind of like a castle gate!
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3 id="header">Most of the time? What if it fails?</h3>
        <p>Sometimes, the enemy can get through both the wall and the gate. However, we have one more section in our first line of defense.
            <br>Like all good kingdoms, we have guards standing just inside the gate. These guards are called <button class="bold innatedata" onclick="location.href='Microvilli.html'">microvilli</button>.
            <br>They are small, hair-like structures that line the inside of our intestines. They help to absorb nutrients, but also help to fight off invaders. What awesome knights!
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3 id="header">But what if even the <i>guards</i>, i mean <i>microvilli</i>, fail?</h3>
        <p>First, the inside guards rush to the scene, yelling for reinforcements (cytokines create a chemical alarm). This makes blood vessels widen (vasodilation), <br>allowing more immune cells to flood the area — like extra knights arriving to fend off the attackers.
            <br>
            <br>
            As the battle rages, the area may become red and swollen. This is because there are so many guards (blood cells), that its getting a bit jam-packed.<br> The heat you feel is like the castle’s fires being stoked to try and burn the enemy <i>alive</i>!<br>
            <br>
            Once the threat is neutralized, the castle starts to repair itself. The guards clean up the remnants of the battle (phagocytosis) and patch up the walls (tissue repair), <br>making sure the castle is stronger against future assaults. In the end, the inflammatory response is all about protecting and healing the castle, ensuring it remains a stronghold against future invaders!</p>
