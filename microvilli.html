        <p><b>Microvilli</b> are tiny finger-like or hair-like projections found on the surface of epithelial cells in various parts of the body, including the intestines and respiratory tract. They play a key role in the immune system by increasing the surface area for absorption and secretion.</p>

        <p>One important function of microvilli is to <i>enhance the trapping of pathogens</i> within the mucus, allowing for more effective removal of harmful invaders. They help transport trapped pathogens toward the body’s exit points, such as the throat or digestive tract.</p>
        
        <p>In addition, microvilli contain various receptors that can recognize pathogens, alerting the immune system to potential threats. This early detection is crucial for initiating an appropriate immune response.</p>
        
        <p>Overall, microvilli contribute significantly to the body’s <b>first line of defense</b> by aiding in the protection and maintenance of a healthy internal environment.</p>
